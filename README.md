I created a Python script based off an assignment given to me by my Data Analysis and Visualization Bootcamp. I created a Python script that analyzes the [budget_data.csv]data.
PyBank
I calculated the following:
The total number of months included in the dataset

The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
Then I printed the results on a text file named [budget_analysis.txt]

PyPoll
Next I was given a set of poll data called [election_data.csv] and was tasked with calculating the following:
The total number of votes cast

A complete list of candidates who received votes

The percentage of votes each candidate won

The total number of votes each candidate won

The winner of the election based on popular vote
Then I printed the final results on a text file name [election_analysis.txt]
